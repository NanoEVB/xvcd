This is a daemon that listens to "xilinx_xvc" (xilinx virtual cable) traffic and 
operates JTAG over an FTDI in bitbang mode.

This version is hardcoded to use an FTDI cable with an FT2232C chip. It does
not use MPSSE but rather bitbang mode. It uses ftdi_write_async which might
not be available on your platform. You can use the (much slower) non-async
version instead.

To run w/NanoEVB: enter bin dir and run `sudo ./xvcd`
To run w/PicoEVB: enter bin dir and run `sudo ./xvcd -P 0x6015`

To use with vivado, use the following tcl command:

open_hw_target -xvc_url localhost:2542

Have fun!
